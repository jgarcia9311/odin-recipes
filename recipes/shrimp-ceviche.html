    Shrimp ceviche, also known as "ceviche de camarón" in Spanish, is a popular seafood dish that originates from Latin America, particularly from countries like Peru, Ecuador, and Mexico. It is made by marinating raw shrimp in a mixture of citrus juices, typically lime or lemon, along with various seasonings such as onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and chili peppers.

  <p>
    The acid in the citrus juices "cooks" the shrimp, denaturing the proteins and giving them a firm texture and opaque appearance, similar to cooking them with heat. The marinating process typically takes a few hours, during which the flavors meld together, resulting in a refreshing and tangy seafood dish.
