    <li>Cook the flat pasta sheets according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the meat sauce by browning ground beef or Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onions, garlic, and chopped bell peppers if desired. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and seasonings like oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes until it thickens.</li>
    <li>In a separate saucepan, make the bechamel sauce by melting butter over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for a minute. Gradually add milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg if desired.
