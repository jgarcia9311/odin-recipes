  Steps to make pizza
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the pizza dough: Mix flour, yeast, water, and salt in a bowl. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Let it rise for about an hour until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature, usually around 475-500°F (245-260°C).</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough: On a floured surface, roll out the dough to your desired thickness and shape./li>
    <li>Add cheese and toppings: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Then, add your favorite toppings like pepperoni, vegetables, cooked sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza: Carefully transfer the pizza onto a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li>Add finishing touches: Once the pizza is out of the oven, you can add some fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>Slice and serve: Let the pizza cool for a minute or two before slicing it into wedges. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
